## Introduction  
This is a badminton analysis and detection project based on YOLO. The project is still under development, and some bugs remain unresolved.  

## Dataset and References  
- Dataset: [Badminton Shuttle Detection](https://universe.roboflow.com/personal-2xh62/badminton-shuttle-detection/dataset/2/images)  
- Code Reference: [Tennis Analysis](https://github.com/abdullahtarek/tennis_analysis)  

## Features  
- Detects the position of the badminton shuttl.  
- More features will be added in the future.  

## Current Status  
- the training on the dataset is not properly enough need to be fix  
- choose player need to be improved
